## INSPIRATION
I have two young girls at home, who occasionally like to help with chores, and so I was inspired to create something where the entire family, parents included, could engage in chores around the house, and even around the community.

## USER STORIES
Link to my [Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/twPQzL2F/wdi-p3) where I planned out my project.
